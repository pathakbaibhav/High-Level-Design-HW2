The previous example used `sc_signals` for communication. To gain basic understanding of channels, we change the output of `Counter` to use a channel instead of the signal. 

1. In the testbench, instanciate the standard channel `sc_fifo<int> myCountCh`. Create a new module `Monitor` (in file `Monitor.h`) that accepts `myCountCh` as an input and prints to the console the received value once received. You do not need to trace the FIFO channel with the VCD tracer. 

2. Update the `Counter` and `Testbench` to connect to the channel `myCountCh` instead of the signal.
