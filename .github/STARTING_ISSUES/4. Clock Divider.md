1. Create a clock divider module `ClkDiv` (in file `ClkDiv.h`) that is connected to a wire `sc_signal<bool> myClkDiv` in the testbench. After each 4 edges (rising and falling) ```ClkDiv``` should flip the logic state of ```myClkDiv```. 

2. Connect `myClkDiv` to the VCD tracing (similar to ```myClk``` tracing). Validate correct behavior of ```myClkDiv```. Copy and commit the vcd file as ```counter/results/ClkDiv.vcd```.

3. Update the testbench to change connectivity of `Counter` to take the input of `myClkDiv` instead of `myClk`. 

Validate output with GTKWave. Copy and commit the vcd file as ```counter/results/ClkDivCounter.vcd```.
