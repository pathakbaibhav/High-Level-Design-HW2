Retrace the steps from the HW 1 assignment, but reimplement in SystemC

1. Copy the Hello example into a new directory `counter`. Rename source and header files Hello to `Testbench.h` and `Testbench.cpp` and rename the module to `Testbench`. They will become later our testbench. Create `Makefile` in `counter` dir and update the Makefile accordingly. Validate and commit your code. 

2. Create a new module `ClkGen` (in file `ClkGen.h` and its relevant methods in `ClkGen.cpp`) that generates a clock signal with 2ns period. Instanicate `ClkGen` in the testbench `myClkGen` and connect it to a `sc_signal<bool> myClk`. In your comments in code, reason your choice of SC_THREAD vs. SC_METHOD.

3. Create a new module `Counter` (in file `Counter.h`) that increments a count variable `sc_signal<int> myCount` in the testbench on every rising edge of `myClk`. In your comments in code, reason your choice of SC_THREAD vs. SC_METHOD.

4. Use `sc_trace` ([example](https://learnsystemc.com/basic/trace)) to create a VCD file of both the `myClk` and `myCount`. Validate and commit your code. 

Copy and commit the vcd file as ```counter/results/ClkGen.vcd```.
