# Homework 2

This assignment introduces the fundamentals of SystemC modeling. 

It implements the same design from HW 1. You will build a simple design with a clock generator that alternates a clock signal on every cycle, a counter that connects to the clock and increases count on every rising edge. Later you will insert a clock divider between the clock generator and the counter to reduce the clock frequency (which validates the modularity of your design). You will then extend the design to a simple producer / cosumer using a standard channel. 

Please see our [SystemC](https://neu-ece-7368.github.io/#systemc) reference section for links to books and learning material. 

## Overview 

The instructions for ths lab are detailed in the following steps:

 1. (Reserved for feedback branch pull request. You will receive top level feedback there).
 2. [Setup](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/2.%20Setup.md) 
 3. [Clock Generator and Counter](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/3.%20Clock%20Generator%20and%20Counter.md) 
 4. [Clock Divider](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/4.%20Clock%20Divider.md)
 5. [Channel Communication](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/5.%20Channel%20Communication.md) 
   


After accepting this assignment in github classroom, each step is converted into a [github issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues). Follow the issues in numerically increasing issue number (the first issue is typically on the bottom of the list).

## General Rules

Please commit your code frequently or at e very logical break. Each commit should have a meaningful commit message and [cross reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests) the issue the commit belongs to. Ideally, there would be no commits without referencing to a github issue. 

Please comment on each issue with the problems faced and your approach to solve them. Close an issue when done.
